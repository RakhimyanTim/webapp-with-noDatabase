Guest House booking Application with No Database

Manually performed guest house booking seriously suffers due to the paper work overheads.Everything has to be done only during working days and higher authorityâ€™s permission is an absolute requirement. These difficulties were eliminated by providing the entire mechanism online. These manual / existing approaches are also burdened by the Database maintenance since we store the data in a Database.

So our proposed system makes the Guest House Booking online with the help of Google Apps without any kind of Database, this is acheived using Google App Scripting associated with HTML &amp; jQuery. 

The entire functionality is centralized and is available to Anyone, Anytime and Anywhere with Any devices using Google Apps. 

Application is well-organized, and is secure. Strong authentication mechanism is provided so that only the allowed users can book, cancel, update and could check for vacancies. Each function occurs instantaneously in no time at single click. 

Booking information is sent as an E-mail to the user, to the accompanying faculty and to the administrator.

The application is simple, light-weight, Eco-Friendly, Error-free and ultimately with NoDatabase.
